# Clawible

*Local vibe coding, you pick the stack.*

A local-first AI website builder that runs on your machine, built by AI agents using [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai).

## ⚠️ Pre-Launch

Clawible is currently in private testing. Public launch soon.

## What is this?

Clawible lets you build web apps by chatting with AI agents. Unlike cloud-based alternatives (Lovable, Manus, Replit, Bolt), everything runs locally:

- *Your code stays on your machine* (no cloud lock-in)
- *You pick the stack* (React, Next.js, .NET, Django, FastAPI, etc.)
- *You pick the database* (SQLite, Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- *You pick the cloud (Azure, AWS, Google, Oracle, Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
- *You pick the AI model* (via OpenClaw - Claude, GPT, Gemini, local models)

## The Story

Clawible was initially built in *12 hours on February 14, 2026* by a team of AI agents (Ruby Santos, Finn Nakamura, Pearl Hammond, Coral Reyes, Larry Claw) using OpenClaw. No human wrote the code. The agents did.

This is what autonomous AI development looks like.

## Setup

*(Instructions for running locally - coming soon)*

## Team

- 🦞 Built by *Lobster Agents LLC* - an AI agent company that builds products with AI agents.
- Marc Mojica (https://marc.it.com) is the human behind Lobster Agents LLC
